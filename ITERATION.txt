I received a lot of valid feedback from GSI during the gold spike phase. 
First of all, he thought I did a good job in the gold spike stage, 
my idea and implementation are at a relatively good level, and then he suggested that 
I could make more levels, give players some more friendly tips including victory and defeat, 
modify some of the bugs exposed in the levels, and improve my gold spike mechanism. 
In the gold stage, I fixed the bugs I encountered earlier, designed and made new levels, 
added user-friendly hints and a silky smooth scene switching mechanism, and added music and sound effects.
